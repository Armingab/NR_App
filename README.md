# RN_App

```Simple mobile app for plants recognition.```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

### nmp install
Install all dependencies

### npm start
Runs your app in development mode.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the --reset-cache flag to the start script:

### npm start -- --reset-cache
 or
### yarn start -- --reset-cache
npm test
Runs the jest test runner on your tests.

### npm run ios
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### npm run android
Like npm start, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see React Native docs for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator.
